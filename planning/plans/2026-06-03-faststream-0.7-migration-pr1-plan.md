# FastStream 0.7 migration — PR1 (defensive pin + planning scaffold) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Tighten the FastStream pin to `>=0.6,<0.7`, adopt `--cov-fail-under=100`, and scaffold the `planning/` workflow directory mirroring `faststream-outbox`. Lands the PR2 design doc in the same commit so PR2 has a home.

**Architecture:** Pure config + docs change. No runtime code touched. Single commit on `chore/pin-faststream-pre-0.7`. The coverage gate is conditional: if `just test` is not at 100% today, the gate addition gets reverted and deferred to PR2 (recorded as decision in commit body).

**Tech Stack:** `pyproject.toml`, `uv`, `pytest-cov`, markdown.

**Related spec:** `planning/specs/2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-design.md`.

## Task 1: Create the working branch

**Files:** None (git operation).

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm clean tree**

Run: `git status`
Expected: `nothing to commit, working tree clean` (a fresh `planning/` dir from the brainstorming session is acceptable; we'll stage it later).

- [ ] **Step 2: Create branch**

Run: `git switch -c chore/pin-faststream-pre-0.7`
Expected: `Switched to a new branch 'chore/pin-faststream-pre-0.7'`

## Task 2: Establish coverage baseline (precondition for gate adoption)

**Files:** None (read-only test run).

The spec's R8 flags that adopting `--cov-fail-under=100` in PR1 requires the suite to already hit 100%. This task discovers the baseline.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run full suite via Justfile**

Run: `just test`
Expected: All tests pass. Final coverage line at bottom of output shows total `%` covered.

- [ ] **Step 2: Record baseline**

Note the total coverage percentage from the report. There are three branches:

- **If `100%`:** Continue to Task 3 — gate adoption is safe.
- **If `<100%` AND missing lines are trivially testable:** Continue to Task 3 but write the backfill tests in Task 3a (insert before Task 4) before adding the gate.
- **If `<100%` AND gaps are non-trivial:** Skip the gate adoption entirely; remove "adopt `--cov-fail-under=100`" from this PR's scope; record decision in commit body; gate moves to PR2 where the orphaned-branch removal naturally lifts coverage.

## Task 3: Tighten the FastStream pin

**Files:**
- Modify: `pyproject.toml` (line 12)

- [ ] **Step 1: Read current dependencies block**

Run: `sed -n '9,14p' pyproject.toml`
Expected output:
```
requires-python = ">=3.13,<4"
license = "MIT"
dependencies = [
    "faststream~=0.6",
    "redis>=5.0",
]
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Edit the pin**

Change `"faststream~=0.6"` to `"faststream>=0.6,<0.7"` on line 12.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify edit**

Run: `grep -n "faststream" pyproject.toml | grep -v module`
Expected: `12:    "faststream>=0.6,<0.7",`

## Task 4: Adopt `--cov-fail-under=100` (conditional on Task 2)

**Files:**
- Modify: `pyproject.toml` (line 67)

**Skip this task if Task 2 step 2 selected the third branch (`<100%`, non-trivial gaps).**

- [ ] **Step 1: Read current pytest config**

Run: `sed -n '66,70p' pyproject.toml`
Expected output:
```
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = "--cov=. --cov-report term-missing"
asyncio_mode = "auto"
asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = "function"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Append the coverage gate to addopts**

Change `addopts = "--cov=. --cov-report term-missing"` to `addopts = "--cov=. --cov-report term-missing --cov-fail-under=100"`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify edit**

Run: `grep -n "addopts" pyproject.toml`
Expected: `addopts = "--cov=. --cov-report term-missing --cov-fail-under=100"`

## Task 5: Regenerate lockfile

**Files:**
- Touched (gitignored, not committed): `uv.lock`

`uv.lock` is gitignored in this repo, so the file is local-only. The regeneration confirms the resolver is happy with the tightened pin.

- [ ] **Step 1: Regenerate lock**

Run: `uv lock`
Expected: `Resolved N packages in <time>` with no error. The `faststream` line in `uv.lock` should resolve to a `0.6.x` version (verify by `grep '^name = "faststream"' -A 2 uv.lock`).

- [ ] **Step 2: Sync environment**

Run: `uv sync --all-extras --all-groups --frozen`
Expected: Sync succeeds against the frozen lock.

## Task 6: Verify the gate (re-run suite)

**Files:** None.

- [ ] **Step 1: Re-run full suite under the new gate**

Run: `just test`
Expected: All tests pass; if Task 4 ran, the final line is `Required test coverage of 100% reached`. If Task 4 was skipped, this is just a re-confirmation that the pin change didn't break anything.

## Task 7: Scaffold `planning/` (likely already present from spec-writing)

**Files:**
- Create (if missing): `planning/specs/.gitkeep`
- Create (if missing): `planning/plans/.gitkeep`

- [ ] **Step 1: Check current state**

Run: `ls -la planning/specs planning/plans 2>&1`
Expected: Both directories already exist with `.gitkeep` files and a design doc in `planning/specs/`. (Created at spec-writing time.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Touch any missing `.gitkeep` files**

If either `.gitkeep` is missing:
Run: `touch planning/specs/.gitkeep planning/plans/.gitkeep`

## Task 8: Confirm design + plan docs are on disk

**Files:**
- Verify: `planning/specs/2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-design.md`
- Verify: `planning/plans/2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-pr1-plan.md` (this file)
- Verify: `planning/plans/2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-pr2-plan.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: List planning files**

Run: `ls planning/specs planning/plans`
Expected output:
```
planning/plans:
.gitkeep
2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-pr1-plan.md
2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-pr2-plan.md

planning/specs:
.gitkeep
2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-design.md
```

## Task 9: Add `## Workflow` section to CLAUDE.md

**Files:**
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Read current CLAUDE.md to confirm anchor**

Run: `grep -n "^## " CLAUDE.md`
Expected output:
```
5:## Commands
11:## Tests
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Insert `## Workflow` between `## Commands` and `## Tests`**

After the `## Commands` block (which ends with the `just install` line on line 9) and before the `## Tests` heading on line 11, insert this block (mind the leading blank line):

```markdown

## Workflow

Per-feature workflow: brainstorming → spec in
`planning/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-design.md` → writing-plans →
plan in `planning/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-plan.md` →
executing-plans / subagent-driven-development →
requesting-code-review → finishing-a-development-branch.

Topic slugs are kebab-case descriptions (e.g. `faststream-0.7-migration`),
not story IDs.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify section order**

Run: `grep -n "^## " CLAUDE.md`
Expected output:
```
5:## Commands
11:## Workflow
22:## Tests
```
(Line numbers approximate; the important thing is `## Workflow` appears between `## Commands` and `## Tests`.)

## Task 10: Verify gitignore does not eat new plan files

**Files:** None (read-only check).

- [ ] **Step 1: Sanity check the gitignore rule**

Run: `git check-ignore -v planning/plans/2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-pr1-plan.md`
Expected: exit code `1` (no output) — the file is NOT ignored.

If exit code is `0` and output names `plan.md` as the rule: the gitignore rule is matching too aggressively (would surprise me but verify). In that case, edit `.gitignore` to anchor the rule: change the bare `plan.md` line to `/plan.md` so it only matches the root.

## Task 11: Run lint

**Files:** None.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run lint**

Run: `just lint`
Expected: All four steps (`eof-fixer`, `ruff format`, `ruff check --fix`, `ty check`) green. Note: `eof-fixer` may auto-add newlines to `.gitkeep` or CLAUDE.md — re-stage afterward.

## Task 12: Stage and commit

**Files:** All modified/created files this PR.

- [ ] **Step 1: Stage changes**

Run:
```
git add pyproject.toml \
        CLAUDE.md \
        planning/
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm staged files**

Run: `git status --short`
Expected output (order may vary):
```
M  CLAUDE.md
M  pyproject.toml
A  planning/plans/.gitkeep
A  planning/plans/2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-pr1-plan.md
A  planning/plans/2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-pr2-plan.md
A  planning/specs/.gitkeep
A  planning/specs/2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-design.md
```

If `uv.lock` shows up in `git status` despite being gitignored, do **not** stage it — confirm `.gitignore` still lists `uv.lock`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify no per-call kwarg accidentally landed**

Run: `git diff --cached pyproject.toml`
Expected: only the two single-line edits (pin + addopts).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore: pin faststream <0.7 and adopt planning/ workflow

- pyproject.toml: faststream~=0.6 -> >=0.6,<0.7. Explicit upper bound
  makes intent visible and lets the 0.7 migration land in a feature
  branch without users pulling unfinished work.
- pyproject.toml: addopts adds --cov-fail-under=100 (matches sister
  faststream-outbox project). Hardens the coverage gate before the
  0.7 migration (PR2) removes branches.
- planning/: scaffold planning/specs/ + planning/plans/ with .gitkeep
  files; mirrors the sister faststream-outbox layout. Includes the
  faststream-0.7 migration design and the two plan files so PR2 has
  a home.
- CLAUDE.md: new ## Workflow section pointing at the planning/ layout.

Companion PR migrates to faststream 0.7 and drops 0.6 support
(>=0.7,<0.8).
EOF
)"
```

(If Task 4 was skipped, drop the `--cov-fail-under=100` bullet from the body.)

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify commit**

Run: `git log -1 --stat`
Expected: single commit with the message above and the staged files.

## Task 13: Push and open PR

**Files:** None (git remote operation).

- [ ] **Step 1: Push branch**

Run: `git push -u origin chore/pin-faststream-pre-0.7`
Expected: `* [new branch]` line and a hint URL for opening the PR.

- [ ] **Step 2: Open PR via gh**

```bash
gh pr create --title "chore: pin faststream <0.7 and adopt planning/ workflow" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

- Tightens the FastStream pin from `~=0.6` to `>=0.6,<0.7`. The companion PR migrates to 0.7 and drops 0.6 support.
- Adopts `--cov-fail-under=100` (matches sister `faststream-outbox` project).
- Scaffolds `planning/specs/` and `planning/plans/` and lands the 0.7 migration design + two-PR plan files.

## Test plan

- [ ] `just lint` passes
- [ ] `just test` passes at 100% coverage
- [ ] `planning/specs/` and `planning/plans/` are tracked by git
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` shows the new `## Workflow` section between `## Commands` and `## Tests`
EOF
)"
```

(If Task 4 was skipped: drop the second bullet of the Summary block.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Note PR URL**

The `gh pr create` command outputs the PR URL. Record it for the user.

---

## Verification (acceptance gate)

The PR is done iff:

- [ ] `git diff main..chore/pin-faststream-pre-0.7 -- pyproject.toml` shows only the pin edit and (if applicable) the `--cov-fail-under=100` addition.
- [ ] `git grep -n "faststream~=0.6"` returns nothing on the branch.
- [ ] `planning/specs/2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-design.md` exists and is tracked.
- [ ] `planning/plans/2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-pr1-plan.md` (this file) exists and is tracked.
- [ ] `planning/plans/2026-06-03-faststream-0.7-migration-pr2-plan.md` exists and is tracked.
- [ ] `planning/specs/.gitkeep` and `planning/plans/.gitkeep` exist and are tracked.
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` contains the `## Workflow` section between `## Commands` and `## Tests`.
- [ ] `just lint` clean on the branch tip.
- [ ] `just test` green (at 100% if Task 4 ran).
- [ ] PR is open with the prescribed title and body.
